Task 1 : Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the testing data.
Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
